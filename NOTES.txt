To start the Nodejs Thyform Server, 

Type "ssh -i ~/.ssh/serveo_key -R thyform.serveo.net:80:localhost:7000 serveo.net" in command prompt.

Then we access through,

https://thyform.serveo.net/


To setup Serveo SSH tunnel,

1. make .shh folder in users/[user_id]/
2. and enter cmd "ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f .ssh/serveo_key" in cmd prompt.

    * .ssh - created folder called ".shh" (name must be '.shh').
    * serveo_key - it file type is "File" (not txt file and name can be any).
      And this must given in inside '.shh' folder.
      And we dont need to create maually this. above command create this file with keygen text.
      We only create '.shh' folder in 'users/[user_id]' folder.
3. Then we enter this command "ssh -R thyform.serveo.net:80:localhost:7000 serveo.net"
   But now display one warning that tells to that need to verify our google account or github account.
   So, they give two Links. here we have google account,So we ctrl + click google account. 
   then serveo verify our google account by we selecting google account. then in browser show one message
   that is "serveo successfully verified [our_google_account] successfully.
4. Then re-try then enter above (first part) url to start thyforms server.

Here we can modify name in the place of ports area,before ports area and place of keygen file  for future modification(first part).
